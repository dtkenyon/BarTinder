# BarTinder
Party Planning Application 

# Purpose
To provide the user with a list of alcoholic drinks that can be made with the input ingredients, and to include in the aforementioned list alcoholic drinks that may be made with the addition of a few more ingredients. Ultimately, BarTinder is a party planning application regarding drinks.

# How to use BarTinder
The user will first confirm they are of the age 21 years or older, the legal drinking age in the United States of America. If this box is not checked, the user will not be allowed to use the app. Once the age is confirmed, the user will press the START button. The user is directed to another screen with three buttons; ALCOHOL, MIXERS, and MIX IT UP!. Alcohol and Mixers when pressed behave similarly, displaying a dialog box to the user with a checklist of corresponding drinks (either alcohol or mixers). The user may scroll through the list and check off the drinks available to them. Once they are finished with the list, OK is selected and the dialog box disappears, along with a toast display of the selected items. Once the user selects items from Alcohol and Mixers, the MIX IT UP! button is pressed and the user is directed to an output screen, displaying a list of drinks that can be made with the ingredients available, and suggested drinks with ingredients that are still required. Each drink has a creative name with the recipe following directly underneath.
